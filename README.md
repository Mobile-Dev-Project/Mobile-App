## Project Overview
SuomiStay.Ay is a mobile application designed to streamline hotel bookings across Finland. It allows users to book hotels based on their location and rating, offering a centralized booking system that simplifies user interactions by eliminating the complexities of navigating multiple booking platforms.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project was to build a full-stack mobile application from front-end to back-end, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the entire development process. The app features an aesthetically pleasing front-end and a well-structured back-end, showcasing effective and efficient coding practices.

## Build Status
